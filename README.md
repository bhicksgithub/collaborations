# collaborations

Some information about what's here:
1. "SFA Streaming" - C++ application to read image frames from the Princeton Instruments PhotonMAX 512 and PixeLINK cameras. Saving the files in all of their 16-bit glory is supported with `cfitsio`.
2. "SFA modeling" - Python code written to model the pupil and generate a PSF of the SFA test-bed. `fringepattern.py` is a class that generates a fringe pattern across the pupil.
3. "PhotonMAX characterization" - Python code to analyze different aspects of the PhotonMAX 512 response. Filenames are mostly (and by mostly I mean not at all) indicative of what's going on.
